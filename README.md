Staff Roster Convert
====================

This application converts the automatic staffing reports into a single xlsx spreadsheet.

It takes all the sheets and add tables and freezes the titles.

It also adds extra sheets for the roster:

* 'Active' which does not have checked out responders
* one sheet for all the major groups (MC, LOG, etc)
* a sheet for responders with two days left
* a sheet for responders with 'negative' days off
* a sheet for responders without supervisors
* a sheet for all the other periodic reports
  * air travel roster
  * upcoming shifts
  * arrival roster
  * open staff requests
